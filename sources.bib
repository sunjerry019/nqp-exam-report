  abstract = {When combined with Krylov projection methods, polynomial filtering can provide a powerful method for extracting extreme or interior eigenvalues of large sparse matrices. This general approach can be quite efficient in the situation when a large number of eigenvalues is sought. However, its competitiveness depends critically on a good implementation. This paper presents a technique based on such a combination to compute a group of extreme or interior eigenvalues of a real symmetric (or complex Hermitian) matrix. The technique harnesses the effectiveness of the Lanczos algorithm with partial reorthogonalization and the power of polynomial filtering. Numerical experiments indicate that the method can be far superior to competing algorithms when a large number of eigenvalues and eigenvectors is to be computed.},

  abstract = {We introduce a mechanism stabilizing a one-dimensional quantum many-body phase, characterized by a certain wave vector \$k\_0\$, from a \$k\_0\$-modulated coupling to a center site, via the protection of an emergent \$\textbackslash mathbb Z\_2\$ symmetry. We illustrate this mechanism by constructing the solution of the full quantum many-body problem of hardcore bosons on a wheel geometry, which are known to form a Bose-Einstein condensate. The robustness of the condensate is shown numerically by adding nearest-neighbor interactions to the wheel Hamiltonian. We identify the energy scale that controls the protection of the emergent \$\textbackslash mathbb Z\_2\$ symmetry. We discuss further applications such as geometrically inducing finite-momentum condensates. Since our solution strategy is based on a generic mapping from a wheel geometry to a projected ladder, our analysis can be applied to various related problems with extensively scaling coordination numbers.},
